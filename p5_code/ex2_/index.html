<h2> UFOs Take Over </h2>

<p> 
  This piece highlights my exciting adventure in Art 101, where I explored two custom functions: adding with/without arguments to them. I also implemented a "child" and "parent" function for my UFOs and the environment. Creating animations for the clouds and the UFOs was quite simple and required only a little coding.
</p><p>
  However, I encountered some difficulties with the sun. Initially, I wanted to create a small triangle for the rays, but that approach was taking too long. To overcome this, I looked up different methods to create the rays while staying true to my original idea. Fortunately, I found a helpful source that guided me in implementing the solution into my code.
