<h2> Take a step higher </h2>

<p> 
  I won't say this was entirely my first time working with code and creating a website because it isn't. However, it was 
  challenging to create one again since the last time I built a website was back in high school, around four years ago. 
  Additionally, making the rollover or clickable regions was just as difficult because this was the first time I had manipulated 
  code in this way. There was so much to learn in just a few days of being in class Art 101, and my brain struggled to keep up. 
  Nevertheless, with a little help, I created a decent code that I am quite proud of.

  And if you were curious as to where my clickable regions are, check at these 5 places and you'll find it.
