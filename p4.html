  <b>Monster House</b>
  <br>
  This metal symbolizes my story of a dysfunctional household that I lived in not long ago, 
  until I decided to run away because I could no longer endure it. I felt as if I was losing 
  myself. There were many nights when the world felt overwhelmingly dark, and I wished that I 
  would never wake up again. The barred windows, doors and garage represent the prison I was 
  trapped in. As a child, I was never allowed to play outside or interact with other kids in 
  the neighborhood, not even in my own backyard. I was always forced to stay in my room, playing 
  with my dolls. The cracks in the house symbolize the anger my parents felt while I was under their 
  care. They would create holes or cracks in the walls when they yelled at me if I didn't meet their 
  demands. The neglected plant in front of the house reflects how the home was falling apart.
</p><p>

 Crows, often seen perched nearby, represent the darkness that enveloped my home. They serve as a 
 reminder of the ominous atmosphere and the foreboding experiences I endured. Their presence symbolizes 
 the weight of sorrow and the haunting memories that linger, echoing the pain and turmoil of my childhood.

    <b>Scorching Truth</b>
    <br>
     For the ‘Luck of the Draw’ project, I drew the topic of fire, which I found to be an engaging 
     and manageable subject. At first, I considered focusing on the recent wildfires in Los Angeles, 
     as they have been prominently featured in the news. However, I decided to take a broader approach 
     by exploring the concept of fire in general.
    </p><p>

     In my project, I present a variety of articles that discuss the different causes of fire, such as 
     gender reveal, drought, and arson, as well as provide valuable prevention tips to help reduce the 
     risk of fire spreading. I aim to create a comprehensive resource that not only informs viewers about 
     the origins of fires but also educates them on effective safety protocols.
    </p><p>
     
     To further enhance my project, I plan to conduct a controlled fire demonstration. This will allow me to 
     visually illustrate the potential hazards and the rapid destruction that fire can cause to homes and 
     communities. Through this hands-on approach, I hope to underscore the importance of fire safety measures 
     and encourage responsible behavior when it comes to fire management. My overall goal is to leave viewers 
     with a deeper understanding of fire's impact and how they can protect themselves and their properties.
